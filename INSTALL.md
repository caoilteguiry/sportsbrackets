Setup
-----
1. Go to https://github.com/caoilteguiry/sportsbrackets and fork the project.
2. Copy the settings_local.py.template file to settings_local.py. This file will contain server-specific settings and sensitive data that shouldn't be versioned.
3. Edit the DATABASES setting within settings_local.py.
4. Sync the database:

```sh
python manage.py syncdb
```
5. Start the server:

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000 to verify that everything worked okay.


Initial Data 
------------
There is some "initial data" stored in home/fixtures/initial_data.json. This will create some data for the following models:
* City
* Country
* FixtureType
* ResultType
* Sport
* Team
* Tournament
* Venue

Dummy Data
----------
Dummy data can be generated by running ```utils.generate_test_data()```. Since this function interacts with django models, 
you'll have to run from within the django shell. Start the django shell by running:

```sh
python manage.py shell
```

From here import the ```utils``` module and run ```generate_test_data```:

```python
import utils
utils.generate_test_data()
```

This should generate dummy users, tournaments, fixtures and predictions. The number of records created can be tweaked 
by passing parameters to `generate_test_data()`. Run:

```python
help(utils.generate_test_data)
```

to see the available args.
